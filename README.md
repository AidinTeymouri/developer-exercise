# ABX Developer Exercise
This exercise is designed to demonstrate a candidate's abilities across a range of competencies in software development with Typescript. 

## Instructions
- Fork the repository
- Create a basic addition and subtraction calculator which implements the following rules:
  - On triggering an 'add' action, add 5 to the current total
  - On triggering a 'subtract' action, subtract 5 from the current total
  - At any point in time we should be able to see the history of provided additions and subtractions (outputting to the console is fine, but feel free to create a UI implementation)
  - Implement at least three (3) of the demonstratable concepts listed below
- Create a pull request with your solution

**NOTE: Only submissions written in Typescript will be accepted.**

## Grading
You will be scored on the following:
- Code cleanliness
- Code reusability
- Understandability
- Documentation

## Demonstratable concepts
You are free to make your solution to this exercise as simple or as complicated as you want based off the above criteria. At least three (3) of the below concepts *must* be demonstrated in your implementation, but we recommend implementing as many as possible to adequately demonstrate your abilities.
- Caching layer
- Database storage
- Containerization
- Unit testing
- Automated e2e testing
- Microservice implementation
- RESTful API
- User interface
- Application CLI
- Blockchain integration (big points for this!)
